This is the first assignmnet for Artificial Intelligence course where I implemented A* algorithm, Iterative deepeing Algortihms and Depth First Search Algorithm for the 8 Puzzle problem.

I created a class Named Node that will store each node while exploring like the current state, cost, it's parent, etc. 

Depth First Search and Iterative deepening is in one file while the A* algotihm is in the other file.
